## addscript
Continuously writes a number larger than the number created before it. Works on *nix systems with a bash shell.

---

##To run: <br>
<br>
Open up the terminal and type:<br>
`chmod +x count.sh` <br>
then <br>
`./count.sh`<br>
to run the script.<br>
<br>
If you want this script to be accessable within the system, move it in to a directory of your `$PATH`<br>
An example of this would be the `C:\Windows\System32` in windows and `/usr/bin` in most *nix systems
